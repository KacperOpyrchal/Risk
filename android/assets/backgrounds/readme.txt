ASCENSION: ADVENTURE BACKGROUNDS

This pack contains all the unique backgrounds in Ascension: Adventure, plus a few more that aren't used in the current version of the game. Some of these are original, some are edits of other art from OpenGameArt, and some are edits of art from Heroine Dusk (the game Ascension: Adventure is based on).

Most of these backgrounds are provided at 320x240, but they can be scaled to 160x120 using nearest-neighbour scaling with no loss in quality. They were edited at 160x120 and scaled up for Ascension: Adventure.

All backgrounds are intended to use the same 256-color palette, which is included in both Photoshop and GIMP formats. (cerium.act/cerium.gpl). Some of the extra backgrounds are not yet paletted.

The exception to this is original art that is licensed CC0 (Public Domain), in which case crediting is recommended but not required. You must still credit myself and adhere to the terms of the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

If you only use part of this art pack, you only need to attribute the parts that you use.

(I recommend that "based on" attributions are placed directly below if your medium allows it)

My understanding of the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license is that you must give credit in a way that is appropriate for the medium, and you do not have to follow the creator's recommendations exactly.
