Based on DENZI's GUI artwork: http://opengameart.org/content/denzis-gui-artwork
Medicine Storm's modifications from original are:
    Added rain animation.
    Added snow animation.
    Reworked stars to look more like a night sky & added starwheel effect.
    Positioned Sun and Moon for day/night cycle and moon phases.
    Added more cloud layers for day, night, dawn, and dusk.
    Consolidated and organized all features into easily consumable layers.

Each folder in this pack represents a layer. PNG files in each layer (folder) can be stacked to create a composite scene or animation. Each folder's number indicates the z-order it should be in; 1 being at the very front, and 99 being at the very back. (If a folder is not numbered, that folder's images have no z-order in relation to their peers.)
